## :oncoming_police_car: Roadmap:

-   [x] Initial release
-   [ ] Further image optimisation for all supported providers. See [@nuxt/image issues](https://github.com/nuxt/image/issues).
-   [ ] Add password authentication

## :rocket: Quick Start

These instructions will help you set up a production deployment as fast as possible.

1. Clone the repo or use the Vercel deploy button below to do it automatically.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fc1llo%2Fgallery)

2. Delete all images in `images` and replace with your own.

3. Commit & push changes to see your brand new image gallery in action!

For deploying with any other method, only the ipx provider is officially supported.

## :computer: Local Development

_Note_ this project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. Replace with `npm run` or `yarn` if needed.

Get started

```
git clone https://github.com/c1llo/gallery.git
```

```
cd gallery
```

```
pnpm install
```

Development mode

```
pnpm dev
```
## :spider_web: PWA functionality

Read how to configure here: [@kevinmarrec/nuxt-pwa](https://github.com/kevinmarrec/nuxt-pwa-module)

By default it is enabled if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is not equal to `development`.

When enabled, any cached (already opened) content/pages will be available offline. A future goal
is to have full precaching with workbox of all assets on install to enable it to work fully offline.

It is possible to add custom service workers with the module.

## :parachute: Supported  production deployment methods

-   With Docker [see Dockerfile](Dockerfile) (deploy to any PaaS that supports Docker or self-host). DigitalOcean app platform is recommended.
-   With Vercel: [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fc1llo%2Fgallery)

**Note** to host with Docker you will need to change the image provider to the self-hosted [`ipx`](https://v1.image.nuxtjs.org/providers/ipx) provider within the Nuxt config:

```
//nuxt.config.ts

image: {
    provider: "ipx",
    ...
},

```

See instructions for deploying on Vercel [here](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/vercel).
It works out of the box and by default the vercel provider is used by `@nuxt/image-edge` for image optimisation.
